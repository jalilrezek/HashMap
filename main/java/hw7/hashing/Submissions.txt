Number 10 at 12:05PM on April 11: Passes insert case 4. It was after this one that I somehow started failing insert case 4 even though
I thought I made no changes to the code besides deleting out useless statements.
 Remove throws exception is not resolved, but that was just from a debugging
print statement where I try to print out the key, but if key was null, would fail test. Easy fix - if key is
not null, then print.

13: Confirmed that insert() was not what caused insert case 4 to start failing because I copy and pasted insert()
from Submission 10 into my code and resubmitted and it still fails insert case 4

14: Problem resolved. growAndRehash() was the problem. Copy and pasted from Submission 10 into my code, and it passes
insert case 4 now. Insert case 2 and 3 still failing.
Tried using a text comparison tool. The only differences between the growAndRehash() from submission 12 and the one
from Submission 10 is that one had a bit more whitespaces. So, I have no idea what was wrong. (Insight below)

15 & 16: On 15, insert case 4 failed. On 16, it succeeded. Both times I submitted the same zip file.
Therefore, the issue was not that something was different in my code. Somehow my code is wrong and it's producing
different results on different runs of the autograder which makes no sense.

Somewhere before 20: Updated hashCode() to deal with negative hashCode() values. Do the modulo of M, then if negative,
re-add M to it. Now, I pass test case 3.

21: Failed "insert works case 4" 2 or 3x beforehand submitting the same zip file, now I pass it. Therefore, i know that
"insert works case 4" is random.

29-30: Pass Insert Case 4 for all 3 of these. Pass case 3 as well. Failing case 2 still (been failing 2 and 3 all
along)
